## 🏗️ **My Projects**

Here are some of my recent projects and repositories:
- **[LeafSpec (Python, Flask, Pytorch)](https://github.com/AhmadRafiq90/Fyp_repo)**  
  A mobile that classifies leaf images to their respective plant species.
  
- **[Skin Lesion Detection and Analysis Using Image Processing (C++)](https://github.com/AhmadRafiq90/Connected-Components-Labelling)**  
  A project focused on image processing and machine learning techniques for skin lesion detection.

- **[Neurons as Threads and Propogation through forked Processes (C++)](https://github.com/AhmadRafiq90/Neurons-Simulator)**  
  This project implements a basic neural network using process-based parallelism, forward and backward pass is handled by forking new processes.
  
- **[HTML Parser using C++ (C++)](https://github.com/AhmadRafiq90/Html-Parser)**  
  This project processes the HTML tags using Stack Data structure and the tags implemented are a little complex than normal HTML function Tags each having a unique and interesting functionality.
